For this project from the Odin Project course, I had to write a Rock Paper Scissors game.
Writting a function for the selection of the computer wasn't too complex. I used the function Math.random*10 that choose a random interger. I got rid of the choice 0 so there was only 9 options which the same probability for each outcome.
For the function for one round of the game, the main issue was that the output was the right one for each situation (computer: Rock vs player: paper).
The last function is a bit more tricky. It's a function repeating 5 times the one round function. But the game function needs to use the returned value of str but it can't accessed it because it's inside the other function so not defined globally.
